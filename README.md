Python loaders for yaml, into MS SQL


With more moving into yaml, I'm looking to build up a basic platform of tools to load the yaml files into appropriate database tables. As I'll be wanting to work on this from windows boxes, python seemed appropriate.

With the use of SQL Alchemy, porting to other relational databases should be relatively simple too.
